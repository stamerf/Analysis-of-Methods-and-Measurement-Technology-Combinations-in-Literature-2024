# Analysis of Methods and Measurement Technology Combinations in Literature (2024)

This repository contains the raw data and analysis for a literature review focused on the intersection of metrology and machine learning. The goal is to examine the methods and measurement technologies used in recent publications within this domain.

## Repository Contents

- **data.xlsx**: The raw data extracted from the literature review. This Excel file includes details about the methods and measurement technologies identified in the surveyed papers.
- **analysis.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that processes the data and generates a heatmap visualizing the relationships between methods and measurement technologies. The notebook uses Python for data analysis and visualization.
- **heatmap.svg**: The resulting heatmap, exported as an SVG file for easy sharing and publication.

## Usage

1. Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the notebook to process `data.xlsx` and generate the heatmap.
3. The heatmap will be saved as `heatmap.svg` in the repository.

## Purpose

This project aims to provide insights into how different measurement technologies and analytical methods are combined in the literature, helping researchers identify trends and gaps in the field of metrology and machine learning.

Feel free to use or adapt the data and analysis for your own research.
